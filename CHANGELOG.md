# Changelog

All notable changes to the AI RAG Product Checker project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-25

### Fixed
- **Critical: API Router Registration**
  - Fixed missing router registration in `app/main.py` that prevented all product endpoints from being accessible
  - Added `app.include_router(products_router, prefix=settings.api_prefix)` to properly register API routes
  - All product verification endpoints now work correctly:
    - `POST /api/v1/products/new-verify-image` - Hybrid vision verification endpoint
    - `GET /api/v1/products/verify/{product_id}` - ID-based verification endpoint

- **Production Startup Loop Issue**
  - Fixed infinite restart loop in production environment caused by incompatible configuration
  - Separated development and production configurations in `run_production.py`:
    - Development mode: Uses reload without uvloop/httptools (prevents conflicts)
    - Production mode: Uses uvloop and httptools with multiple workers (optimal performance)
  - Resolved conflict between hot-reload and high-performance event loop libraries
  - Production server now starts cleanly with 4 workers and performance optimizations enabled

### Changed
- **Server Configuration Improvements**
  - Refactored `run_production.py` for clearer separation of development vs production settings
  - Development mode now uses single worker with hot reload for better developer experience
  - Production mode optimized with uvloop, httptools, and multiple workers
  - Improved configuration comments for better maintainability

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-25

  - Data documentation (data/information.md)

- **Code Quality**
  - Linting and formatting standards
  - Type hints and validation
  - Proper project structure with separation of concerns

- **Fast Fuzzy-Matching Path**
  - Quick database product matching without LLM calls for simple/common cases
  - Reduces latency and API costs for straightforward product lookups
  - Confidence-based scoring for match quality assessment

- **Intelligent Fallback Mechanisms**
  - Rule-based matching fallback when LLM confidence is low
  - Vision service fallback for product type detection when LLM classification uncertain
  - Layered approach ensures robust matching even with partial or ambiguous data

- **Improved Application Lifecycle & Logging**
  - Enhanced startup/shutdown lifecycle management with FastAPI lifespan context manager
  - Automatic database table creation and connection verification on startup
  - Comprehensive logging setup using Loguru for better observability
  - Improved error handling and logging during initialization

- **Enhanced Middleware & Health Endpoints**
  - CORS middleware with configurable allowed origins, methods, and headers
  - GZip compression middleware for optimized response size (minimum 1000 bytes)
  - Root endpoint (`GET /`) providing app info, version, environment, and status
  - Health check endpoint (`GET /health`) for monitoring and orchestration
  - Proper dependency injection for settings in health check endpoint
