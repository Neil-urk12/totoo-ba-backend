# Release Notes - v1.0.1

**Release Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Repository:** Neil-urk12/buytimebackend  
**Type:** Patch Release (Critical Bug Fixes)

---

## üö® Critical Fixes

This patch release addresses two critical issues that prevented the application from functioning correctly in production:

### 1. API Router Registration Issue ‚úÖ

**Problem:** The `/new-verify-image` endpoint and all product verification endpoints were not accessible, returning 404 errors.

**Root Cause:** The products router defined in `app/api/products.py` was never registered with the FastAPI application in `app/main.py`. Despite having complete endpoint implementations, the router was not included in the application's routing system.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Added in app/main.py
from app.api.products import router as products_router

# Registered router with API prefix
app.include_router(products_router, prefix=settings.api_prefix)
```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ All product verification endpoints now work correctly
- ‚úÖ `POST /api/v1/products/new-verify-image` - Hybrid vision verification
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/v1/products/verify/{product_id}` - ID-based verification
- ‚úÖ API documentation now shows all available endpoints

---

### 2. Production Startup Loop ‚úÖ

**Problem:** The production server was stuck in an infinite restart loop, preventing the application from starting successfully.

**Root Cause:** Configuration conflict in `run_production.py` where uvloop and httptools were enabled globally, including in development mode with hot-reload. These high-performance libraries are incompatible with reload mode, causing continuous crashes and restarts.

**Previous Configuration:**
```python
# ‚ùå Problematic: uvloop/httptools set globally
config = {
    "app": "app.main:app",
    "loop": "uvloop",      # Conflicts with reload
    "http": "httptools",   # Conflicts with reload
    "workers": 1,
}

if settings.environment == "development":
    config.update({"reload": True})  # Causes loop!
```

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# ‚úÖ Fixed: Separate configurations
if settings.environment == "development":
    # Development: reload without uvloop/httptools
    config.update({
        "reload": True,
        "reload_dirs": ["app"],
        "workers": 1,
    })
else:
    # Production: performance optimizations
    config.update({
        "loop": "uvloop",
        "http": "httptools",
        "workers": 4,
        "reload": False,
        "access_log": False,
    })
```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Production server starts cleanly without restart loops
- ‚úÖ Development mode works with hot-reload enabled
- ‚úÖ Production gets full performance optimizations (uvloop, httptools)
- ‚úÖ Proper worker configuration for each environment

## üìä Verification

### Testing Performed

All endpoints verified and working:

```bash
# Verify routes are registered
$ python -c "from app.main import app; print([r.path for r in app.routes])"
['/openapi.json', '/docs', '/docs/oauth2-redirect', '/redoc', 
 '/api/v1/products/verify/{product_id}', 
 '/api/v1/products/new-verify-image', 
 '/', '/health']
```

### Available Routes

| Method | Endpoint | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| `GET` | `/` | ‚úÖ Working |
| `GET` | `/health` | ‚úÖ Working |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/products/verify/{product_id}` | ‚úÖ **Fixed** |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/products/new-verify-image` | ‚úÖ **Fixed** |
| `GET` | `/docs` | ‚úÖ Working |
| `GET` | `/redoc` | ‚úÖ Working |

## üîß Configuration Improvements

### Server Configuration Refactoring

**Development Mode:**
- Single worker for easier debugging
- Hot reload enabled for fast iteration
- No uvloop/httptools (prevents conflicts)
- Full access logging

**Production Mode:**
- 4 workers for optimal throughput
- uvloop for 2-4x faster async I/O
- httptools for optimized HTTP parsing
- Access logging disabled for performance
- Reload disabled for stability
